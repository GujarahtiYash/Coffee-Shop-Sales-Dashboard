# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Dashboard
Business Case This project analyzes multi-year sales data from a coffee shop chain to understand revenue trends, customer purchasing behavior, and product performance. The goal was to transform raw transaction-level data into meaningful insights that support better business decisions around sales strategy, product mix, and operational planning.

Analytical Approach I cleaned and structured transactional data covering product types, store locations, time of purchase, and revenue. Using Excel, I built an interactive dashboard to analyze:

Monthly and yearly revenue trends
Sales contribution by product category and store location
Peak sales hours and high-performing weekdays
Customer purchasing patterns across time
Key Insights

Clear seasonality patterns emerged, with certain months consistently outperforming others.
Beverage categories like coffee and tea contributed the highest share of total revenue.
Specific store locations and time windows drove a disproportionate share of sales, highlighting optimization opportunities.
Business Impact This dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly identify growth opportunities, optimize staffing and inventory planning, and make data-driven decisions to improve overall revenue performance.
